drupal-wordcounter
==================

A drupal word counter. Counts the number of words in Drupal node textareas.

This currently works with textareas only and not WYSIWYG iframes. We have an issue for that though!

##Setup

1. download module into your default module folder (usually sites/all/modules).
2. enable module

When you edit or add content, you will see a count appear right above the text area.

That's all this does!
